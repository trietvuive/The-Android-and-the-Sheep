Your actions were closely monitored by Sisyphus.

Sisyphus, while attempting to help the injured robot, experienced firsthand the apathy of the common people to robots’ well-being. This radicalized Sisyphus to the fact that this society and its people will not budge on robot’s equality and that violence is the only means.

Something sinister stirs in Sisyphus.
